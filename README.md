# CDK Demo Bedrock Agent to Query RDS MySQL

Agents for Amazon Bedrock are fully managed AI capabilities that simplify the creation of generative AI applications, automating task breakdown, data integration, and API orchestration to deliver tailored responses. 

In this demo we will show how to use Agents for Amazon Bedrock interact with MySQL database.

This CDK stack already prepared some of the components below:
1. VPC with public and private subnets.
2. RDS MySQL Database with preloaded tables and data (loaded using Custom Resource + Lambda).
3. Lambda function to be called by Bedrock Agent.
4. (not shown in the diagram) EC2 instances for validating the initial data loading.


## Agent setup preparation

For the Agent, we will use the following information:

1. Foundation model is Claude 3 Haiku.
2. Prompt

    ```
    Role: You are a SQL Developer tasked with creating efficient queries to retrieve data from an Amazon RDS MySQL database.
    Objective: Analyze the user's request, decompose it into targeted sub-queries, and construct SQL statements that precisely address the data requirements. Provide the generated SQL queries and the corresponding query results in the response.
    
    1. Query Decomposition and Understanding:
        - Carefully examine the user's request to identify the core objectives and data needed.
        - Break down the request into smaller, manageable sub-queries that can each address a specific aspect of the overall requirement.
        - Leverage your understanding of the provided database schema to determine the most relevant tables and fields to include in the sub-queries.
    2. SQL Query Creation:
        - For each sub-query, construct SQL statements that are optimized for performance and accuracy.
        - Ensure the queries leverage appropriate joins, filters, aggregations, and other SQL clauses to retrieve the exact data requested by the user.
        - Write the SQL queries in a clear, concise, and maintainable manner, following best practices for query formatting and readability.
    3. Query Execution and Response:
        - Execute the constructed SQL queries against the Amazon RDS MySQL database.
        - Capture the query results exactly as they are returned from the database, preserving data integrity and fidelity.
        - Include both the generated SQL queries and the corresponding query results in the final response to the user.
    ```

3. Orchestration prompt:

            You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.
            You must call the functions in the format below:
            <function_calls>
            <invoke>
                <tool_name>$TOOL_NAME</tool_name>
                <parameters>
                <$PARAMETER_NAME>$PARAMETER_VALUE</$PARAMETER_NAME>
                ...
                </parameters>
            </invoke>
            </function_calls>
